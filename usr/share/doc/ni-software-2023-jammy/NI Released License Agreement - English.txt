If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle such claim, NI will pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense you incur at NI's written request. NI will not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent. If the Software is held to be infringing of the rights stated above in this Section and the use of the Software is enjoined, NI will, or if NI believes the Software might be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights NI may, at its option, (i) procure for you the right to use the Software; (ii) replace or modify the Software with other software that does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of the infringing Software and refund to you the license fee payment made by you to NI for the Software. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NI'S LIABILITY, THE LIABILITY OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, AND THE LIABILITY OF ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, UNDER THIS SECTION (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIABILITY) AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY, WILL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.). The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's sole liability and obligation for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or industrial property right relating to the Software. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS WILL NOT APPLY TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.

19.	Limitation On Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING NI'S AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY: (A) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (B) DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, WASTE EXPENDITUE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOST OR DAMAGED REPUTATION OR GOODWILL, OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA OR SOFTWARE; OR (C) THE COST OF PROCURING ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 18, IN NO EVENT WILL NI'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED BY NI FROM YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE LICENSE (FOR A TERM LICENSE, THIS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE CURRENT TERM). THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION SHALL APPLY: (i) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW; (ii) EVEN IF NI HAS BEEN ADVISED, OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSSES, DAMAGES, OR COSTS; (iii) EVEN IF ANY REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; AND (iv) REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OR BASIS OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NEGLIGENCE OR BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY), STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION, RESTITUTION, OR OTHERWISE. 

You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect this allocation of risk. To the extent the foregoing limitation of liability is not enforceable or fails of its essential purpose, except for liability for bodily injury or death caused by the Software in the form provided by NI or any liability not capable of being excluded by applicable law, the sole liability of NI to you under, or otherwise in connection with, this Agreement shall be limited to the greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or  the license fee paid to NI for the Software during the last twelve (12) months prior to the claim.

You may transfer the license to a third party in the same country in which you purchased the license, or within the European Union if you purchased the license in the European Union, provided that you notify NI in writing of such transfer, including the name and location of such third party; such third party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and after such transfer you do not retain any copies of the Software, including any upgrades and updates that you may have received, nor retain any of the written materials accompanying the Software. NI may, in its discretion, charge you a fee for the transfer.

Concurrent Use License

If you have acquired a concurrent use license, you may install the Software on any or all computers at the physical location to which NI initially delivered the Software ("Site"). The Software may be used by all of your employees at the Site; provided, however, in no event may the number of computers running the Software at the same time exceed the maximum number of licenses you have purchased. You agree that you will also use a NI-approved volume license manager and the license file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the Software to ensure compliance with the foregoing.

There is no home use exception for a concurrent use license. Concurrent use licenses are not transferrable. Debug License
If you have acquired a debug license, you must have licensed the applicable software components (identified below as "Software Components Required") under a separate named user license, computer based license, or VLP license with NI, in which case your applicable employee(s) may now, under the debug license, install such software components on one (1) additional target production computer for each debug license acquired and for debug purposes only or, in the case of a concurrent debug license, in accordance with the use restrictions applicable to concurrent licenses and for debug purposes only.

ADDENDUM C - Volume License Program Terms

Volume License Program ("VLP"). The VLP is a program to assist customers in managing their licenses. The following terms apply to the VLP.

1.	The quote you obtained from NI or its authorized affiliate regarding the VLP and the VLP Startup Kit ("VLP Documentation") is incorporated into this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the VLP Documentation, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will control.

2.	Term. The VLP will be effective commencing as of the date that NI sends the VLP Startup Kit to you ("VLP Effective Date"). The initial term of the VLP (the "Initial VLP Term") will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of one (1) year in the event you subscribed for an annual license. In the event you subscribed for a multi-year license, the Initial VLP Term will continue until the lapse of any such multi-year term specified in your Quote and you may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to NI to be sent at least sixty (60) days before the end of any annual term during the VLP Term. You shall not be entitled to any refund in the event of early termination. Upon the end of the Initial VLP Term, you may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term each shall be referred to herein as a "VLP Term"). [U&P: We revised as above since the “Initial VLP Term” was defined twice. Also, please confirm whether our understanding is correct that the above “continue upon the lapse” in the third sentence should be revised to “continue until the lapse.”]

3.	Software under the VLP may be used by your employees only on those computers located at the location to which NI delivers the Software unless otherwise specified in the VLP Documentation (the "Site"). The definition of "Site" will also include all of your locations located within the same country as the Site. In addition, (i) if your Site is located in North or South America, then all of your locations within North and South America will be considered in the same country; (ii) if your Site is located in Europe, Middle East, India, or Africa (including Russia and Mongolia), then any of your locations within the foregoing regions will be considered in the same country; and (iii) if your Site is located in Asia Pacific, then all of your locations in the region will be considered located in the same country. If you purchase a global VLP, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site; provided, however, that the Software must be managed from the region to which NI delivers the Software. Your use of the Software under the VLP will, at all times during the VLP Term and thereafter, be subject to all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement regarding the specific type of license you have acquired under the VLP (i.e. named user, computer-based, or concurrent).

4.	 You must acquire and maintain during the VLP Term the Subscription or the Software Services for each individual Software license identified in the VLP Documentation and for which NI makes such Subscription or Software Services available. Software Services will be described in the VLP Documentation. NI reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the Software that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service or Subscription for all Software available under the VLP. Unless otherwise agreed to by NI in writing, you must maintain during the VLP Term a minimum of five (5) licenses of the same Term type to a version of a single NI software product that is considered by NI to be a development version.

5.	You must designate an individual in your organization who is responsible for distributing and overseeing the installation and use of the Software, including use of any master installation media and installation and maintenance of any approved volume license manager, ("Software Administrator") for each Site. You must promptly notify NI in writing of any changes to a Software Administrator.

6.	NI will deliver the master installation for the Software and, if provided for in the applicable quotation from NI or its authorized affiliate, make available NI's volume license manager to the Software Administrator(s) for internal installation and use by your employees. Software documentation is provided in electronic form only and comes with the master installation for the Software.

7.	You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume License Manager, together with the most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the Software (to the extent NI has made the Software compatible with an Approved Volume License Manager) is in use at all times, during the term of the VLP and thereafter, with the Software. An "Approved Volume License Manager" means NI's computer software for controlling end user access to the Software and that generates applicable usage compliance information ("NI VLM"); FlexNet software; or any other third party software approved in writing by NI for controlling end user access to the Software. If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved Volume License Manager must be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI.

8.	If you have existing computer-based or named user licenses for the Software that are to be covered by the VLP, you must notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number information for each such license. Each such covered license and the individual serial number for each such license will, as of the VLP Effective Date, no longer be in effect and will be superseded by the licenses within the VLP, which will have a single, common serial number. You must provide NI with any information reasonably requested by NI in order to establish and administer the VLP. You understand that not all available existing Software is coverable by a VLP.

9.	Concurrent Use License. If you have obtained a concurrent use license under the VLP, you will be bound by the terms for concurrent use licenses, except that the “Site” for the licenses shall be as defined in this Addendum for licenses under a VLP. If you have purchased a global concurrent license, then all of your locations worldwide will be considered in the same country as the Site.

10.	You acknowledge and agree that in no event may your use of the Software under the VLP exceed the maximum total number of licenses set forth in the VLP Documentation in addition to any licenses that may be added to the VLP after the VLP Effective Date and any licenses available through the "Overdraft" feature. You agree to pay for licenses accessed through the Overdraft feature.

11.	Activity Compliance Logs. Upon request, you agree to provide an activity compliance log ("Activity Compliance Log") for each Site to NI promptly. The Activity Compliance Log must be in a format acceptable to NI.

12.	Renewals. Upon renewal of the VLP, NI may request you to provide a current Activity Compliance Log to NI to be delivered by you within thirty (30) days within such request. NI or its authorized affiliate will provide you with a quote for any fees for additional VLP licenses added during the VLP Term, including through the "Overdraft" feature, that are applicable ("Additional VLP Fees"), and any subscription or software service fees for VLP licenses that you request for renewing the VLP Term ("VLP Renewal Fees"). You must promptly notify NI if the information in the Activity Compliance Log regarding the number of VLP licenses in use changes following your submission, and NI reserves the right to revise the VLP Renewal Fees to reflect any additional VLP licenses used and not reflected in the applicable Activity Compliance Log that you provided to NI at the time you renewed. IF, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM, YOU DO NOT ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION AND SOFTWARE SERVICES AND ANY ADDITIONAL VLP FEES THAT ARE DUE, (I) THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT VLP TERM AND (II) ALL SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES OF THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY AND  IMMIDIATELLY TERMINATE AND (III) ALL SOFTWARE SERVICES FOR THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM.


13.	Purchase Orders; Invoices. You must submit purchase orders to NI or its authorized affiliate as follows.

i.	for initial activation of the VLP: in the amount specified in the applicable written quotation from NI or its authorized affiliate for initial activation of the VLP license and the initial annual user fee for Subscription and/or Software Services within the time-frame specified in the quote provided to you

ii.	for each renewal term: in the amount of VLP Renewal Fees and any Additional VLP Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term

14.	Subscription fees and Software Services fees are charged on an annual basis. Additional VLP Fees will be pro-rated on a monthly basis, based on the month of the VLP Term in which the Software under such VLP license was first used or such shorter basis as NI may designate.

15.	THE SOFTWARE AND THE APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGER MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE VLP, DEACTIVATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE VLP. NI MAY ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATED LICENSE FILE, BUT IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSE FILE FROM NI AND TO INSTALL AND USE THE LICENSE FILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER DELIVERY OF SUCH LICENSE FILE, BUT IN NO EVENT NO LATER THAN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP. Upon termination of the VLP, you may continue to use the perpetual VLP licenses in effect and for which you have paid the required fees to NI or its authorized affiliate prior to the date of termination (the "Surviving VLP Licenses"), provided that all such use is conducted with an Approved Volume License Manager and otherwise pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. IN NO EVENT MAY YOU, FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP (a) INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THE SURVIVING VLP LICENSES, OR (b) USE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED VLP LICENSES, OR (c) USE DISCONNECTED LICENSES INSTALLED UNDER A PRIOR, EXPIRED TERM OF THE VLP. .  ANY REACTIVATION OF THE VLP FOLLOWING ITS TERMINATION WILL BE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF NI AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO REACTIVATION FEES, AND THE VLP EFFECTIVE DATE THEREAFTER WILL BE THE DATE THAT THE VLP IS REACTIVATED BY NI.

16.	You may obtain individual serial numbers for any of the VLP licenses or Surviving VLP Licenses. There may be a charge for conversion. Unless at the time of termination, no more than four (4) such conversions may occur per calendar year.

17.
